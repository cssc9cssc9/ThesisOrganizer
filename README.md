## Thesis Organizer
## Motivation
In academic research, managing the interrelations of numerous papers becomes challenging. To simplify this, the Thesis Organizer tool was developed. It efficiently searches for cited and referenced theses, identifying connections with locally available papers. By employing Wiki Markup and mermaid syntax, the tool visualizes the relationships between various theses, enhancing understanding and organization of academic literature. This tool is particularly useful for researchers who need to track and analyze complex networks of scholarly papers.
